SEVERE: The web application [] created a ThreadLocal with key of type [java.lang.ThreadLocal] (value [java.lang.ThreadLocal@35aa2ca4]) and a value of type [com.opensymphony.xwork2.inject.ContainerImpl] (value [com.opensymphony.xwork2.inject.ContainerImpl@3758de82]) but failed to remove it when the web application was stopped. Threads are going to be renewed over time to try and avoid a probable memory leak.
